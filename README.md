## Short description
The goal of this project is create fully connected map and find the desirable random point on the map starting from center. The achieve both purpose I used Breadth First Search algorithm. Every time user clicked on the application, a new random fully connected map is appear after it is created. And solving algorithm starts to find desirable point. Depends on the random map and location of the point finding time may change.
